This document is meant to introduce you to the functionality of the task09 package. The task09 package was created as part of Task_09 for the class GEOL 590 at The University of Tennessee Knoxville.

## Adding two numbers with `add2`

`add2` is a simple function that allows you to add any two numbers together. These numbers are input into the function as arguments.

## Example:

Let's try adding the numbers 5 and 7,

```{r}
task09::add2(5, 7)

```
which as shown above add up to 12!
